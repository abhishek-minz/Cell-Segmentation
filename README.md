# Cell-Segmentation
Semantic segmentation of cell nuclei using a modified U-Net architecture

Dataset: Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2018

The focus of the project was on developing a novel neural network for semantic segmentation of cells in microscopic images by modifying the backbone and skip-connections of the U-Net architecture. The findings of the study demonstrated that the proposed model outperformed the baseline model in terms of segmentation accuracy while having fewer number of parameters. The development environment used Python and Keras for model building with TensorFlow as the backend.
